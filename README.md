## Decisions

First, I have to say that I am not happy with the result, since I know that I can improve both: the performance and the UI of the project.

I decided to create a simple home page, where searches can be done, but due to lack of time I couldn't implement the search in the other views.

In the results, I was only able to display the 10 results that are displayed, as I was not able to figure out how to display the following API results.

And as for the individual view of the results, I decided to show some general details of the items.

## Improvements
- I could create a backend to deliver better formatted data to the frontend.
- Implement search in all views.
- Improve the UI.
- Deploy it to test it online.
- Implement the advanced search.
